### Welcome to FerShibli's Profile!

I'm currently working with 
- React Native for iOS, Android and Web (yes, react-native-web is a struggle... üò´ )

But I love working with
- Python (vanilla, Django, Flask, FastAPI, ...)

I have a lot of experience with projects for
- Medical applications
- Governments
- Gamming (Godot, Game Maker, RPG Maker, Unity, Unreal Engine, Pygame ‚ù§Ô∏è )

Almost all my contributions are private (unfortunately), but I would love to contribute with public repositories, so feel free to reach out!

If you find any of my projects helpful or interesting, please consider giving them a ‚≠êÔ∏è. It's a great way to show your support and encouragement.
